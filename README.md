This is Jack de la Motte (jdelamot@calpoly.edu) and Luke Watt's (luwatts@calpoly.edu) lab report 1 for CSC 466 - Knowledge Discovery from Data.

For our analysis, we used Python and its pandas, matplotlib, and numpy packages.

run our code with:
```
python3 baby-names.py
```

note that you may need to
```
pip install pandas
pip install numpy
pip install matplotlib
```

We are only turning in one python script which handles the computations and plotting for all three of our queries.
